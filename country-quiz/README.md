This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Country Quiz Challenge 

The Code is ReactJS solution to the [country-quiz](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/Bu3G2irnaXmfwQ8sZkw8) challenge on https://devchallenges.io/challenges. I used the third party API https://restcountries.eu/ for creating questions and answers for the app. I used https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to bypass browser CORS policy. <br>
Working demo of the project is live at http://violet-screw.surge.sh/

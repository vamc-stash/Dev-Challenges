This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Weather App Challenge 

The Code is ReactJS solution to the [weather-app](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv) challenge on https://devchallenges.io/challenges. I used the third party API https://www.metaweather.com/api/ for accessing weather and location data. I used https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to bypass browser CORS policy.
Working demo of the project is live at feeble-sneeze.surge.sh
